        index.txt        	This file.
        Bargraph.tanner 	S-Edit Design. Used to generate TPR and SPICE netlist.
        Bargraph3layer.tdb An L-Edit document containing the BARGRAPH layout.  
                         	  The toplevel cell (bargraph) was generated using
                         	  L-Edit/SPR with 3 routing layers and over-the-
                             cell (OTC) routing enabled.
        gsr_lib_3layer.tdb A library containing the minimum set of SCMOSLib
