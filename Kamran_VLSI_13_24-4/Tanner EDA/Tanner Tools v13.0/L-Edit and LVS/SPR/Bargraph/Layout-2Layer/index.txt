        index.txt        This file.
        Bargraph.tanner 	S-Edit Design. Used to generate TPR and SPICE netlist.
        bargraph.tdb     An L-Edit document containing the BARGRAPH layout.  
                           The toplevel cell (bargraph) was generated using
                           L-Edit/SPR with CLK/CLR routed as global signals.
        gsr_lib.tdb      A library containing the minimum set of SCMOSLib
                           Standard Cells for use in standard cell place & route
                           of the BARGRAPH example (including Global Signal
                           Routing). This library supports MOSIS/ORbit N-Well
                           2.0um Process Technology.
        Bargraph.tpr     A TPR netlist file for the BARGRAPH circuit.
        Bargraph.cap     A nodal capacitance file for the BARGRAPH circuit,
                           generated by L-Edit/SPR.
		  Bargraph.sdf     An SDF file for the BARGRAPH circuit, generated by L-Edit/SPR.
        morbn20.ext      An extraction definition file for L-Edit/Extract.
                           This process definition file supports MOSIS/Orbit
                           N-well 2.0um Process Technology.
        Bargraph.sp      A SPICE file containing the BARGRAPH design example generated
                           from S-Edit - used for LVS.
        Bargraph.spc     A SPICE file extracted from the layout of the BARGRAPH design
                            example - Used for LVS.
        Bargraph.vdb     LVS setup file for the BARGRAPH design example.
        Bargraph.lvs     Output from LVS comparision.
        Bargraph.lst     Listing file from the LVS comparision.
        ext_devc.md      Model definition file for the SPICE files.
        morbn20.xst      A cross-section definition file for L-Edit/Cross-
                         Section. This process definition file supports 
                         MOSIS/Orbit N-well 2.0um Process Technology.
